## Problem Statement
The volatility in onion prices poses a significant challenge to market stability and economic planning in India. Factors such as unpredictable weather, supply-demand imbalance, and limited storage facilities contribute to sudden price fluctuations, impacting both farmers and consumers.

## Objective
This project aims to predict and forecast onion prices using a hybrid approach that combines:
- **Traditional Machine Learning Models** for classification into price categories: Low, Mid, High.
- **Deep Learning (LSTM)** for time-series forecasting to capture temporal patterns and long-term trends.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Web-scraped daily onion price data from 2012 to 2024 using Agmarknet.
2. **Data Analysis**: Pre-processed the dataset by handling missing values, categorizing prices, and identifying seasonal trends.
3. **Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Machine Learning Models: KNN, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, Neural Network.
   - Deep Learning Model: LSTM for sequential forecasting.
4. **Evaluation**: Models evaluated on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and MSE.

## Key Features
- Categorizes onion prices into three ranges: Low, Mid, and High.
- Implements LSTM to effectively capture long-term dependencies in price trends.
- Utilizes both classification and forecasting techniques to provide actionable insights.
